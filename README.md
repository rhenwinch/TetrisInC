# Tetris in C

_A simple and not-so optimized Tetris game implemented in C using ASCII only._

This project was started because of such curiousities on game developing in C. Appararently, optimization is not included on the list of objectives to be accomplished on this project; the main goal was to finish it as fast as possible.

## Features

- It has most functions of what a usual Tetris game does.
- Mainly used printf() for everything. Literally.
- Will save game data to a CSV/Excel
